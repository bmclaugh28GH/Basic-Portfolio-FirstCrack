                            Hello! I've got over 30 years in software development, having supported applications supporting diverse goals such 
                            as personnel distribution and assignment, magazine circulation fulfillment for a business lobby, help desk issues tracking and administration, 
                            sales for hierarchy and commission tracking, and most recently, cable media advertising sales. 
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            I'm originally from south Jersey (Go Eagles! Go Phillies!). I got a BA in computer science from Rutgers University, and 
                            served in the US Navy on a ship in Rhode Island and doing IT work in enlisted personnel assignment in northern Virginia. 
                            For the last twenty years I've supported domestic advertising sales for Discovery Communications. In the '90s I played 
                            drums and guitar in a band here in DC called Racecar. Best palindrome bandname ever'
                        </p>
                         
                        <p>
                            I'm the proud father of two great kids; my wife and I live with them in Silver Spring, MD with our dog, Mabel. 
                            In my free time I enjoy playing guitar (poorly), reading, watching TV, and sneaking in a few minutes on my son's Xbox.
